# Anomaly Detection in Football Referee Decisions
The objectivity of referee decisions in football is a recurrent point of controversy, recently amplified by the betting allegations in Turkey. This project aims to scientifically investigate potential biases by combining public match statistics with betting odds data. The goal is to detect statistically unexpected (anomalous) decisions (e.g., penalties, red cards) made by referees under specific conditions (e.g., high-stakes matches). The analysis seeks to provide data-driven insights into sports integrity and decision-making processes.
